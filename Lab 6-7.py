#1. Create a Python file named lab_6-7
#2. Create a program that asks a user to input 3 numeric values

#create input variables for all of them
Number1 = int(input("Enter Number: "))
#create input variables for all of them
Number2 = int(input("Enter Number: "))
#create input variables for all of them
Number3 = int(input("Enter Number: "))

#3. Construct a list of the 3 input values, in the order that the user gave them.

#create a list of the numbered vlaues
N_U_M_B_E_R_L_I_S_T = [Number1, Number2, Number3]

#4. Have the program display a list with each of the values as integers that have been doubled

#create revised list to double to numbers
N_U_M_B_E_R_L_I_S_T_2_0 = [Number1 * 2, Number2 * 2, Number3 * 2] 
#print Numbered List
print(N_U_M_B_E_R_L_I_S_T_2_0)

#â€¢ You may assume accurate input values.
