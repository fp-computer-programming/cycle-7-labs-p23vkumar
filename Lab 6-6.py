#1. Create a Python file named lab_6-6
#2. Create a program that asks a user to input 5 unique words.

word_1 = input("Enter Word: ")
word_2 = input("Enter Word: ")
word_3 = input("Enter Word: ")
word_4 = input("Enter Word: ")
word_5 = input("Enter Word: ")

#3. Construct a list of the 5 input values, in the order that the user gave them.

W_O_R_D_L_I_S_T = [word_1, word_2, word_3, word_4, word_5]

#4. Have the program display a list where each index corresponds to the length of the word given by the user at the corresponding index.

length1 = len(word_1)
length2 = len(word_2)
length3 = len(word_1)
length4 = len(word_2)
length5 = len(word_1)
L_E_N_G_T_H_L_I_S_T = [length1, length2, length3, length4, length5]
print(L_E_N_G_T_H_L_I_S_T)

#â€¢ You may assume accurate input values. NO LOOPS
